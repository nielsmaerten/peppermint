Great! Peppermint and your Dropbox are now connected.

Sit tight, images will be added as they are upvoted on Reddit.

In the meantime, set up your Mac or PC
to use Peppermint's images as your desktop wallpaper.

To save space, old images are deleted after 30 days.
Visit https://peppermint-wallpapers.web.app to change this.

Have fun!
